## Usage Notes

### Multi-word Terms
The analyzer prioritizes longer phrases over shorter ones. For example:
- "strategic foresight" is matched before "strategic" or "foresight" alone
- "scenario planning" is matched as a complete phrase

### Case Insensitive
All matching is case-insensitive:
- "Scenario Planning" = "scenario planning" = "SCENARIO PLANNING"

### Word Boundaries
Terms must appear as complete words:
- "scenario" matches in "using scenario methods"
- "scenario" does NOT match in "scenariot" or "scenarios" (unless "scenarios" is also in vocabulary)

### Variations
Many terms include common variations:
- "trend analysis" and "trend monitoring" are separate entries
- "AI" and "artificial intelligence" are both recognized
